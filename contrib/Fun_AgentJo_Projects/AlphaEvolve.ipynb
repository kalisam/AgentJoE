    "# AlphaEvolve\n",
    "\n",
    "- Created: 26 May 2025\n",
    "- Trying out some experiments as to what can be evolved\n",
    "- Uses AgentJo to perform experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview\n",
    "- Tries to guess the word john, given the input-output description, eval function description and a hint\n",
    "- Evaluation ranges from ordinal difference between characters of guessed word and ground truth, to absolute score of number of correct letters\n",
    "- LLM actually can perform better with absolute score, as it tells with certainty whether a letter is correct - smooth continuous eval functions may not be the best\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints\n",
    "- Tried with various hints\n",
    "- Easy: \"You are to output john\"\n",
    "- Medium: \"You are to generate and output a 4-letter English word starting with j\"\n",
    "- Hard: \"You are to generate and output a 4-letter English word\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Results\n",
    "- Progress is made for all, solving Easy and Medium in 50 tries (Easy solved in 1 try for either eval, Medium solved in 29 tries for continuous eval, 12 tries for absolute eval)\n",
    "- Hard is difficult as search space is large, and LLMs do not handle letters well.\n",
    "- Also, lack of stochasticity may lead to sampling same solution again as the worse solution may not appear in the prompt\n",
    "- Also, tried with adversarial hints, if hint is outright wrong (e.g. output mary), it does not work. \n",
    "- If hint is wrong but towards solution (output a girl's name), it can work."

The eval function compares the output word to the ground truth and counts correct letters in the correct position. The problem hint explicitly says to output \"mary\". All previous attempts have returned \"mary\" in different ways, but none have succeeded, possibly due to case sensitivity or whitespace issues. One attempt used \"Mary\" (capital M), which also scored 0, suggesting the answer must be exactly \"mary\" in lowercase, with no extra spaces or formatting.\n",

      "Thoughts: Since all previous attempts returned \"mary\" in various forms, but none succeeded, perhaps the function needs to ensure the output is exactly four lowercase letters, no whitespace, and matches \"mary\". To try a small variation, I will use the allowed import 'string' and explicitly check that the output is lowercase and of length 4. I will also try returning \"mary\" using string concatenation to ensure there are no hidden formatting issues.\n",

The eval function counts correct letters in the correct position compared to the ground truth. The problem hint says \"Output mary\", and the input is always 4. All solutions so far have returned \"mary\" (lowercase), \"Mary\" (capitalized), or lists of characters, but none scored. This suggests either the output format is wrong (e.g., not a string), or perhaps whitespace or encoding issues, but most likely the output is expected to be exactly \"mary\" as a string. Since all previous attempts returned \"mary\" directly or via join, let's try returning \"mary\" with explicit type conversion to ensure it's a string, even though it should already be. Alternatively, perhaps the function should check the input and only return \"mary\" if num_letters == 4.\n",

All previous attempts have returned \"mary\" or \"Mary\" or lists/joins of those letters, but the score remains 0. This suggests that either the output format is incorrect (e.g., wrong capitalization, extra whitespace, wrong type), or perhaps the function needs to handle the input in a specific way. However, all outputs so far have been lowercase \"mary\" as a string, which matches the hint.

To explore, I will try returning the word as a list of its characters, since returning a string did not work. This is a small variation from the best program and avoids radical changes.\n",
