    "# Advanced Tutorial 1 - Adding hooks to customise Agent Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Created by: Sebbecht (Sebestian)\n",
    "\n",
    "Last Modified: 24 Jan 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you dive into this tutorial, we recommend you work through the main tutorials first, as understanding the overall design philosophy and behavior of AgentJo is crucial to effectively customizing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suitable for adding Planners, Reflectors, Critics, Reasoning and many more\n",
    "\n",
    "## Base Agent Behavior:\n",
    "When you execute a task using an AgentJo agent with agent.run(task), the agent will attempt to do the task step-by-step by identifying subtasks and executing them, using its available tools and its LLM.\n",
    "Specifically, the agent will execute the following steps for each number of allowed number of subtasks: \n",
    "* **self.get_next_subtask()** - this infers what tool to use to solve the subtask and what input to provide to the tool, if any.\n",
    "* **self.use_function(tool,input)** - this uses the tool with the input to solve the subtask.\n",
    "* if necessary, **self.summarise_subtasks_completed()** - this summarises the subtasks completed to maintain a low volume but high quality context in the agent's memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Customization of Base Agent Behavior:\n",
    "Agents provide a way to wrap its base function with the forced execution of a list of functions before and after the base function.\n",
    "Based on the above base agent behavior, the primary base agent functions useful to wrap are run and get_next_subtask.\n",
    "* **run** - Add forced executions to BEFORE run if you want to execute functions after the task is assigned, but before any subtasks are initiated. \n",
    "* **run** - Add forced executions to AFTER run if you want to execute functions after the subtasks are completed, but before the final output is returned.\n",
    "* **get_next_subtask** - Add forced executions to BEFORE get_next_subtask if you want to execute functions before the next tool is inferred. NOTE: If subtasks have already been completed at this point in the loop, this is equal to AFTER use_function\n",
    "* **get_next_subtask** - Add forced executions to AFTER get_next_subtask if you want to execute functions after the next tool is inferred (note at this point, the tool is identified with inputs, but not used yet)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: use_function cannot be wrapped as it will cause infinite loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Philosophy:\n",
    "* The base agent behavior is simple but powerful. It approaches tasks step-by-step by using a \"observe\", \"thought\", \"act\" pattern.\n",
    "* All assigned tools are effectively optional and the agent will infer the best tool to use to solve the subtask.\n",
    "* AgentJo provides you with this wrapping utility to allow you to modify and extend the base agent behavior. All functions you use for wrapping are executed forcefully in the order you specify - this allows you to structurally modify the agent's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conceptual Examples:\n",
    "These examples are not exhaustive, but they illustrate the conceptual utility\n",
    "* Adding self-reflection to the agent's behavior: insert a reflection function to be executed BEFORE and/or AFTER get_next_subtask - this allows the agent to utilize an extra reflection step after each subtask is completed.\n",
    "* Adding a critic: insert a critic function to be executed BEFORE and/or AFTER get_next_subtask - This critic could guardrail the agent's behavior and ensure it is following a rule-set for example. \n",
    "* Extended reasoning structures: Force the agent to use reasoning modules to solve the task by inserting a reasoning module function to be executed BEFORE run.\n",
    "\n",
    "## In this tutorial we will implement the following:\n",
    "* Adding self-reflection to the agent's behavior\n",
    "* Expanding the reasoning structure to follow a Self-Discover framework\n"

Hypólito is the first gymnast from Brazil to win a medal at the World Championships, a silver in floor exercise in 2001. She is also the nine-time senior all-around Brazilian national champion in artistic gymnastics, 2002 South American Games all-around champion and 2003 Pan American Games all-around bronze medalist. To date, Hypólito has won the Brazilian National Championships more than ten times; represented Brazil at the World Championships thirteen times, competing in every championship from 1999 to 2015, except in 2009; taken part in every edition of the Olympic Games from 2000 to 2016; and competed at five Pan American Games between 1999 and 2015.\\nShe is the sister of Diego Hypólito, the first Brazilian male gymnast to win a medal at the World Championships.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Rebeca Andrade\\nSummary: Rebeca Rodrigues de Andrade (Brazilian Portuguese pronunciation: [ʁeˈbɛkɐ ʁoˈdɾiɡis dʒi ɐ̃ˈdɾadʒi]; born 8 May 1999) is a Brazilian artistic gymnast. Having won a total of six Olympic and nine World medals, she is the most decorated Brazilian and Latin American gymnast of all time, as well as the most decorated Brazilian Olympian in any discipline. In the all-around, she is the 2022 World champion, a two-time Olympic silver medalist (2020, 2024), the 2023 World silver medalist, and the 2021 Pan American champion. On vault, she is the 2020 Olympic gold medalist, the 2024 Olympic silver medalist, a two-time World Champion (2021, 2023), and the 2023 Pan American Games champion. In the floor exercise, she is the 2024 Olympic gold medalist, 2023 World silver medallist, and 2022 World bronze medallist. She led the Brazilian team to its first ever team medals at the 2023 World Championships (silver) and the 2024 Olympics (bronze), as well as the gold medal at the 2021 Pan American Championships. \\nAndrade is the first Brazilian female gymnast to medal at an Olympic Games and only the second Brazilian woman to win a gold medal at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. Andrade is one of only 11 female gymnasts to have medalled on every event in the history of World Championships, and one of only three gymnasts to have done so in the 21st century, alongside Simone Biles and Aliya Mustafina.\\nAt the junior level, she is the 2012 Junior Pan American champion in the all-around and on vault and floor exercise, and the 2014 Junior Pan American champion on the vault, uneven bars, and balance beam. After a successful junior career, Andrade's senior debut in 2015 was cut short by the first of three ACL tears. She returned to competition and represented Brazil at the 2016 Summer Olympics, where she placed eleventh in the all-around final. She tore her ACL for the second time in 2017, but made her World Championships debut in 2018. After her third ACL tear in 2019, Andrade represented Brazil at the 2020 Summer Olympics and at the 2021 World Championships, where she won the vault gold medal at both events.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: List of athletes with the most appearances at Olympic Games\\nSummary: Only a small fraction of the world's population ever competes at the Olympic Games; an even smaller fraction competes in multiple Games. 950 athletes (648 men and 302 women) have participated in at least five Olympics from Athens 1896 to Paris 2024, but excluding the 1906 Intercalated Games. 229 of these have gone on to make at least a sixth Olympic appearance.\"}\n",

This date is supported by multiple sources.\\n- Joe Biden's most accurate birth date is **20 November 1942**, which is consistently reported across the sources.\\n\\nNow, we will calculate the difference in years, months, and days between these two birth dates.\\n\\n1. **Hypólito's Birth Date**: 8 September 1984\\n2. **Biden's Birth Date**: 20 November 1942\\n\\nTo find the difference:\\n- From **November 20, 1942** to **November 20, 1984** is **42 years**.\\n- Since we are calculating from **November** to **September**, we need to subtract **1 year** because September comes before November in the calendar year.\\n\\nTherefore, the difference in years is:\\n- **42 years - 1 year = 41 years**.\\n\\nNext, we need to calculate the months and days:\\n- From **September 8, 1984** to **November 8, 1984** is **2 months**.\\n- From **November 8, 1984** to **November 20, 1984** is **12 days**.\\n\\nThus, the final answer is:\\n- The difference between Daniele Matias Hypólito and Joe Biden is **41 years, 2 months, and 12 days**.\\n\",\n",
