    "# Advanced Tutorial 1 - Adding hooks to customise Agent Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Created by: Sebbecht (Sebestian)\n",
    "\n",
    "Last Modified: 24 Jan 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you dive into this tutorial, we recommend you work through the main tutorials first, as understanding the overall design philosophy and behavior of AgentJo is crucial to effectively customizing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suitable for adding Planners, Reflectors, Critics, Reasoning and many more\n",
    "\n",
    "## Base Agent Behavior:\n",
    "When you execute a task using an AgentJo agent with agent.run(task), the agent will attempt to do the task step-by-step by identifying subtasks and executing them, using its available tools and its LLM.\n",
    "Specifically, the agent will execute the following steps for each number of allowed number of subtasks: \n",
    "* **self.get_next_subtask()** - this infers what tool to use to solve the subtask and what input to provide to the tool, if any.\n",
    "* **self.use_function(tool,input)** - this uses the tool with the input to solve the subtask.\n",
    "* if necessary, **self.summarise_subtasks_completed()** - this summarises the subtasks completed to maintain a low volume but high quality context in the agent's memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Customization of Base Agent Behavior:\n",
    "Agents provide a way to wrap its base function with the forced execution of a list of functions before and after the base function.\n",
    "Based on the above base agent behavior, the primary base agent functions useful to wrap are run and get_next_subtask.\n",
    "* **run** - Add forced executions to BEFORE run if you want to execute functions after the task is assigned, but before any subtasks are initiated. \n",
    "* **run** - Add forced executions to AFTER run if you want to execute functions after the subtasks are completed, but before the final output is returned.\n",
    "* **get_next_subtask** - Add forced executions to BEFORE get_next_subtask if you want to execute functions before the next tool is inferred. NOTE: If subtasks have already been completed at this point in the loop, this is equal to AFTER use_function\n",
    "* **get_next_subtask** - Add forced executions to AFTER get_next_subtask if you want to execute functions after the next tool is inferred (note at this point, the tool is identified with inputs, but not used yet)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: use_function cannot be wrapped as it will cause infinite loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Philosophy:\n",
    "* The base agent behavior is simple but powerful. It approaches tasks step-by-step by using a \"observe\", \"thought\", \"act\" pattern.\n",
    "* All assigned tools are effectively optional and the agent will infer the best tool to use to solve the subtask.\n",
    "* AgentJo provides you with this wrapping utility to allow you to modify and extend the base agent behavior. All functions you use for wrapping are executed forcefully in the order you specify - this allows you to structurally modify the agent's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conceptual Examples:\n",
    "These examples are not exhaustive, but they illustrate the conceptual utility\n",
    "* Adding self-reflection to the agent's behavior: insert a reflection function to be executed BEFORE and/or AFTER get_next_subtask - this allows the agent to utilize an extra reflection step after each subtask is completed.\n",
    "* Adding a critic: insert a critic function to be executed BEFORE and/or AFTER get_next_subtask - This critic could guardrail the agent's behavior and ensure it is following a rule-set for example. \n",
    "* Extended reasoning structures: Force the agent to use reasoning modules to solve the task by inserting a reasoning module function to be executed BEFORE run.\n",
    "\n",
    "## In this tutorial we will implement the following:\n",
    "* Adding self-reflection to the agent's behavior\n",
    "* Expanding the reasoning structure to follow a Self-Discover framework\n"

A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017, under President Barack Obama, and represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate from 1973 to 2009.\\nBorn in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden moved with his family to Delaware in 1953. He graduated from the University of Delaware in 1965 and the Syracuse University College of Law in 1968. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and the U.S. Senate in 1972. As a senator, Biden drafted and led the effort to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act. He also oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. Biden ran unsuccessfully for the 1988 and 2008 Democratic presidential nominations. In 2008, Obama chose Biden as his running mate, and he was a close counselor to Obama during his two terms as vice president. In the 2020 presidential election, the Democratic Party nominated Biden for president. He selected Kamala Harris as his running mate, and they defeated Republican incumbents Donald Trump and Mike Pence. He became the first president to serve with a female vice president and the second Catholic president.\\nAs president, Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recession. He signed bipartisan bills on infrastructure and manufacturing. He proposed the Build Back Better Act, which failed in Congress, but aspects of which were incorporated into the Inflation Reduction Act that he signed into law in 2022. Beginning in March 2021, Biden confronted elevated inflation rates, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 and declined to 2.9% by the end of his term. Biden appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. He worked with congressional Republicans to resolve the 2023 debt-ceiling crisis by negotiating a deal to raise the debt ceiling. Biden responded to record levels of illegal border crossings with extensive use of humanitarian parole and deportations. In his foreign policy, Biden restored America's membership in the Paris Agreement. He oversaw the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan that ended the war in Afghanistan, leading to the collapse of the Afghan government and the Taliban seizing control. He responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorizing civilian and military aid to Ukraine. During the Israel–Hamas war, Biden condemned the actions of Hamas as terrorism, supported Israel's military efforts, and sent limited humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. A ceasefire proposal he backed was adopted shortly before he left office.\\nConcerns about Biden's age and health persisted throughout his term, with Biden's staffers and family members insulating him from scrutiny and managing declines in his acuity. He initially ran for reelection and, after the Democratic primaries, became the party's presumptive nominee in the 2024 presidential election. After his performance in the first presidential debate, renewed scrutiny from across the political spectrum about his cognitive ability led him to withdraw his candidacy. He was replaced by Vice President Harris, who lost to Trump in the general election, and Biden retired after Trump was inaugurated. During his term, historians and political scientists ranked Biden in the upper-middle quartile of U.S. presidents.\\n\\nPage: Cabinet of Joe Biden\\nSummary: Joe Biden assumed office as the 46th president of the United States on January 20, 2021, and his term ended on January 20, 2025. The president has the authority to nominate members of his Cabinet to the United States Senate for confirmation under the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution.\\nBefore confirmation and during cong\"}\n",

      "To calculate the difference in years, months, and days between Hypólito's birth date (September 8, 1984) and Joe Biden's birth date (November 20, 1942), we first convert both dates into a standard format. Hypólito was born on September 8, 1984, and Joe Biden was born on November 20, 1942. The difference in years is calculated as follows: 1984 - 1942 = 42 years. However, since we need to account for the months and days, we look at the specific dates. From November 20, 1942, to November 20, 1984, is exactly 42 years. Now, we need to calculate the months and days from November 20, 1984, to September 8, 1984. Since September is before November in the same year, we subtract one year from our total, giving us 41 years. Now, we calculate the months: from November to September is 10 months backward, and we need to adjust for the days. From September 8 to November 20, we have 12 days in September (from the 8th to the 20th) and 20 days in November. Therefore, the complete breakdown of the time difference is 41 years, 10 months, and 12 days.\n"

      "To calculate the difference in years, months, and days between Hypólito's birth date (September 8, 1984) and Joe Biden's birth date (November 20, 1942), we follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Convert Birth Dates**: Hypólito was born on September 8, 1984, and Joe Biden was born on November 20, 1942.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Calculate Year Difference**: From 1942 to 1984, the difference is 42 years. However, since we need to check the months and days, we will adjust this later.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Calculate Month Difference**: From November 1942 to September 1984, we have:\n",
      "   - Full years from November 1942 to November 1984 = 42 years = 42 * 12 = 504 months.\n",
      "   - From November 1984 to September 1984, we subtract 2 months (October and November).\n",
      "   - Therefore, the total month difference is 504 - 2 = 502 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Calculate Day Difference**: Now, we need to consider the days:\n",
      "   - From September 8 to November 20, we have:\n",
      "     - Days remaining in September after the 8th = 22 days (30 - 8 = 22).\n",
      "     - All days in October = 31 days.\n",
      "     - Days in November up to the 20th = 20 days.\n",
      "   - Total days = 22 (September) + 31 (October) + 20 (November) = 73 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Compile Results**: Now we compile the results:\n",
      "   - Years: 42 years\n",
      "   - Months: 11 months (since we have 502 months, we convert this to years and months: 502 months = 41 years and 10 months, so we have 42 years and 11 months)\n",
      "   - Days: 12 days (since we have 73 days, we convert this to months and days: 73 days = 2 months and 13 days, so we have 11 months and 12 days)\n",
      "\n",
