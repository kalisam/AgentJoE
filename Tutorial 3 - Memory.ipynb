    "- It would be important to learn from past experience and improve the agentic framework - memory is key to that\n",
    "- You can add to the memory bank of your Agents pre-inference (by collecting from a pool of data prior to running the Agent), or during inference (add on in between running subtasks)\n",
    "\n",
    "- In general, for the various Memory classes, you use:\n",
    "    - `append(list_of_memories)`: append a list of memories to the memory bank\n",
    "    - `retrieve(task: str)`: retrieves top_k memories based on task \n",
    "    \n",
    "## Use Memory in Agents\n",
    "- Agent class takes `memory_bank` as a parameter during initialisation of an `Agent`\n",
    "- memory_bank: class Dict[Memory]. Stores multiple types of memory for use by the agent. Customise the Memory config within the Memory class."
